### Abstract

Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory (Optane PMM) is a new kind
of byte-addressable memory with higher density and lower cost
than DRAM. This enables the design of affordable systems that
support up to 6TB of randomly accessible memory. In this paper,
we present key runtime and algorithmic principles to consider
when performing graph analytics on extreme-scale graphs on Optane
PMM and highlight principles that can apply to graph analytics
on all large-memory platforms.

To demonstrate the importance of these principles, we evaluate
four existing shared-memory graph frameworks and one out-of-core
graph framework on large real-world graphs using a machine
with 6TB of Optane PMM. Our results show that frameworks using
the runtime and algorithmic principles advocated in this paper
(i) perform significantly better than the others and (ii) are competitive
with graph analytics frameworks running on production clusters.
