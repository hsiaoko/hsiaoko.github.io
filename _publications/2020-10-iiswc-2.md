### Abstract

Traditionally, parallel graph analytics workloads
have been implemented in systems like Pregel, GraphLab, Galois, and Ligra 
that support graph data structures and graph
operations directly. An alternative approach is to express graph
workloads in terms of sparse matrix kernels such as sparse
matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplication. An API for
these kernels has been defined by the GraphBLAS project. The
SuiteSparse project has implemented this API on shared-memory
platforms, and the LAGraph project is building a library of graph
algorithms using this API.

How does the matrix-based approach perform compared to the
graph-based approach? Our experiments on a 56 core CPU show
that for representative graph workloads, LAGraph/SuiteSparse
solutions are 5x slower on the average than Galois solutions. We
argue that this performance gap arises from inherent limitations
of a matrix-based API: regardless of which architecture a matrix-based algorithm is run on, it is subject to the same inherent
limitations of the matrix-based API.
