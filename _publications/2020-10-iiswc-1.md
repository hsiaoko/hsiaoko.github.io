### Abstract

Graphs play a key role in data analytics. Graphs
and the software systems used to work with them are highly
diverse. Algorithms interact with hardware in different ways and
which graph solution works best on a given platform changes
with the structure of the graph. This makes it difficult to
decide which graph programming framework is the best for
a given situation. In this paper, we try to make sense of this
diverse landscape. We evaluate five different frameworks for
graph analytics: SuiteSparse GraphBLAS, Galois, the NWGraph
library, the Graph Kernel Collection (GKC), and GraphIt. We
use the GAP Benchmark Suite to evaluate each framework. GAP
consists of 30 tests: six graph algorithms (breadth-first search,
single-source shortest path, PageRank, betweenness centrality,
connected components, and triangle counting) on five graphs.
The GAP Benchmark Suite includes high-performance reference
implementations to provide a performance baseline for comparison.
Our results show the relative strengths of each framework,
but also serve as a case study for the challenges of establishing
objective measures for comparing graph frameworks.
