### Abstract

There are relatively few studies of distributed
GPU graph analytics systems in the literature and they are
limited in scope since they deal with small data-sets, consider
only a few applications, and do not consider the interplay between 
partitioning policies and optimizations for computation
and communication.

In this paper, we present the first detailed analysis of graph
analytics applications for massive real-world datasets on a
distributed multi-GPU platform and the first analysis of strong
scaling of smaller real-world datasets. We use D-IrGL, the
state-of-the-art distributed GPU graph analytical framework,
in our study. Our evaluation shows that (1) the Cartesian
vertex-cut partitioning policy is critical to scale computation
out on GPUs even at a small scale, (2) static load imbalance
is a key factor in performance since memory is limited on
GPUs, (3) device-host communication is a significant portion
of execution time and should be optimized to gain performance,
and (4) asynchronous execution is not always better than 
bulk-synchronous execution.
