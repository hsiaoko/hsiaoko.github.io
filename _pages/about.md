# Research Interests

My research are broadly in the field of graph computing and databases, with an emphasis on optimizing runtime systems for shared-memory and heterogeneous architectures of CPUs/GPUs.  This work has been published in SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, BigData, CLOUD. A brief summary of my past work can be found below.

### Single Machine Graph Processing 
I have worked on building a high-level programming model and runtime system that can execute applications on shared-memory or out-of-memory architectures with CPUs or GPUs. For out-of-core graph analytics (e.g., PageRank, SSSP), I improved I/O efficiency, and for graph mining (e.g., Graph Data Cleaning, Pattern Matching), I optimized GPU performance. Relevant results were published in  [[VLDB23](https://hsiaoko.github.io/files/paper/MiniGraph_full_paper.pdf), SIGMOD25, VLDB25]

### Parallel Data Cleaning
I have worked on improving the performance of data cleaning systems on modern hardware like GPU or on distributed cluster. I have also compared different parallel runtime systems for data cleaning, and identified their performance bottlenecks.  Relevant results were published in  [[ICDE22](https://drive.google.com/file/u/0/d/1PpBGov7mavn_xqb21zU7Quo3NnZX78i1/view), [VLDB25](https://hsiaoko.github.io/files/paper/HyperBlocker_full_paper.pdf), TKDE25, SIGMOD25]

### AI4DB
I have leverages machine learning and deep learning model to improve tasks traditionally handled by  human database administrators or classical algorithms, enabling more efficient data processing and resource management. Specially I have designed learned models for sorting, load balancing, and scheduling. Relevant results were published in  [[CLOUD21](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08494.pdf), BigData24]
