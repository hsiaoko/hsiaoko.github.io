I am a Ph.D. student working with [Dr. Keshav Pingali](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pingali/) in the [Intelligent Software Systems Lab](http://iss.ices.utexas.edu/) at the [Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/). I received my masters from the [Department of Computer Science and Automation, Indian Institute of Science](http://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/), where I worked with [Dr. Uday Bondhugula](http://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~uday/).

# Research interests

I am broadly interested in improving the performance of parallel and distributed programs. I work on designing and building programming models, compilers, and runtime systems that enable programmers to extract performance from parallel architectures like clusters of multicore CPUs and GPUs. I am particularly interested in irregular programs that operate on big unstructured data like large graphs, where the parallelism and synchronization are driven by the input at runtime. My recent work is
focused on optimizing communication and scaling out computation in such programs by exploiting domain knowledge.
