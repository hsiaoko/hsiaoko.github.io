I am a Ph.D. student working with [Dr. Keshav Pingali](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pingali/) in the [Intelligent Software Systems Lab](http://iss.ices.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/). I received my masters from the [Indian Institute of Science](http://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/), where I worked with [Dr. Uday Bondhugula](http://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~uday/).

During the summer of 2018, I was a research intern in [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-in-software-engineering-rise/), where I collaborated with several researchers including [Dr. Olli Saarikivi](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/olsaarik/) and [Dr. Madan Musuvathi](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/madanm/).

# Research interests

I am broadly interested in improving the performance of parallel and distributed programs. I work on designing and building programming models, compilers, and runtime systems that enable programmers to extract performance from parallel architectures like clusters of multicore CPUs and GPUs. I am particularly interested in irregular programs that operate on big unstructured data like large graphs, where the parallelism and synchronization are driven by the input at runtime. My recent work is focused on optimizing communication and scaling out computation in graph analytical programs by exploiting domain knowledge.
