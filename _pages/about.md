# Research Interests
My research interests are broadly in the field of 
**graph systems**, **parallel computing** and **data cleaning**
with an emphasis on optimizing runtime systems under 
*single machine* and *heterogeneous* architectures. 
Currently, my focus is on building 
large-scale graph systems by leveraging modern hardware such as GPU.
