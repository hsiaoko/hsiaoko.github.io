Xiaoke Zhu is currently a Phd candidate at [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) (BUAA), supervised by [Prof. Wenfei Fan](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wenfei/). He received his master degree at [Yunnan University](http://english.ynu.edu.cn/) (YNU) in 2020.


# Research Interests
My research interests are broadly in the field of 
**graph systems**, **parallel computing** and **data cleaning**
with an emphasis on optimizing runtime systems under 
*single machine* and *heterogeneous* architectures. 
Currently, my focus is on building 
large-scale graph systems by leveraging modern hardware such as GPU.
